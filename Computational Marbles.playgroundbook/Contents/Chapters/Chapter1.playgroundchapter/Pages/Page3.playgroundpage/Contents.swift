/*:
 Okay, so now you know how to create and add new balls to the cylinder and we have a working [algorithm](glossary://algorithm) and situation to start our challenge.
 * callout(Goal):
 Produce a starting stack that consists of only four marbles, which will produce a never ending game.
 
 Just like last times, every cycle, it causes the two lowest marbles drop out. When the first marble to drop out is a red one `redFellFirst` is executed and when the first marble to drop out is a blue one `blueFellFirst` is executed. The game is over when two or less balls remain in the cylinder. So try to keep at least three balls in the cylinder.
 * note:
 Before you try to find the solution using [trial-and-error](glossary://trial-and-error), think about what you think the solution would be and why. Put yourself to the test and find the solution within 3 trials.
